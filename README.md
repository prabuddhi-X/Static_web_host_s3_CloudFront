## What I leant
- To host a static website on S3 , the files must be upload into root directory of S3 bucket, If files added inside of a     folders it showed 404 error when browsing
- When setuo OAC on CloudFront, S3 bucket policy aslo create as relevent needs

## Notes
- AWS resources are deleted after testing the project to avoid cost.
